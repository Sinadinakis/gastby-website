      'An organic wine is a wine made from grapes that were grown using organic methods, without the use of artificial or synthetic ingredients, chemicals and fertilizers (such as herbicides, pesticides, GMOs, etc.), to maintain the natural microclimate of the soil. To control weeds and pests, we work with nature, not against it, by improving the biodiversity of their vineyard. Thus, the vineyard becomes a self-regulating, natural ecosystem, which is able to deal with internal problems and eliminates the need for artificial and potentially toxic chemicals.',
